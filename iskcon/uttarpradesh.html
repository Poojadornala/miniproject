        <p>Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir is a temple under early stages of construction at Vrindavan, Mathura, India. As planned, it will be the tallest religious monument in the world. At its potential cost of ₹700 crore it is likely to be one of the most expensive temples in world. The temple has been planned by ISKCON Bangalore. The planned effort includes the temple rising to a height of about 210 metres (700 ft) or 70 floors) and a built-up area of 50,000 square metres (540,000 sq ft).[4] The project is set in 25 hectares (62 acres) of land and includes 4.9 hectares (12 acres) for parking and a helipad.</p>

        <section id="History">
        <p>
            The foundation stone laying ceremony of Chandrodaya temple in Mathura district was done on 16 March 2014, on the eve of the auspicious occasion of Holi.</p>
        <p>
            In 1972, Srila Prabhupada, the founder and Acharya of ISKCON spoke about the principle of Yukta Vairāgya right in front of the Bhajan Kutir (a simple and austere dwelling of an ascetic primarily intended to perform his spiritual activities like chanting Krishna's names, writing and teaching) of Sri Rupa Goswami (see picture) to his dozen or more western disciples who were accompanying him on a visit to Vrindavan, India.</p>
        <P>Madhu Pandit Dasa had a meeting with President Pranab Mukherjee where he briefed him about the idea of creating the temple. In March 2014, the Uttar Pradesh Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated the project  and on 16 November 2014, the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee laid the foundation stone of the temple.The temple building is under construction. The original architectural design has been changed twice</P>

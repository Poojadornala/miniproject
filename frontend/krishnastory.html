    <h4>Srimad Bhagavad Gita - Song of God</h4>
    <p>The Bhagavad Gita, or the Song of the Lord, is a dialogue between Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, and his friend and disciple, Arjuna. This dialogue takes place in the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata. The Bhagavad Gita is composed of 701 Shlokas (verses) arranged in 18 chapters. It is one of the best-known philosophical texts of Hinduism, and is said to contain the essence of Upanishadic thought.The Bhagavad Gita occurs just before the great battle of Mahabharata begins. The army mustered by the five Pandava brothers was to fight the battle against the army of the Pandava’s cousin, Duryodhana, who had robbed them (the Pandavas) of their rightful kingdom and further, refused to participate in any plans for a compromise. After making all possible attempts to peacefully get back their kingdom, or even the right to own a mere five villages in the kingdom, the Pandava brothers decided to fight a war to gain justice.</p>
    <p>Arjuna, the third of the five Pandava princes, was perhaps the greatest and most renowned warrior-hero in the Pandava army. Before the battle began, both Duryodhana and Arjuna went to Krishna to seek his aid. Krishna said that he would not personally lift weapons and fight in the battle, but the cousins could choose to have him, unarmed, on their side, or to have the use of his large army. Arjuna chose to have Krishna with him, and Duryodhana was delighted to add the vast, skilled army of Krishna to his forces. Krishna agreed to drive Arjuna’s chariot and thus to be with him throughout the battle.</p>
    <p>Just before the fighting commenced, Arjuna asked Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies, so that he could take a good look at his enemy. In the enemy ranks, Arjuna saw his cousins, other relatives and his teachers. At this crucial moment, Arjuna’s attachment to his preceptors and family came to the fore, and doubt entered his mind as to the ‘rightness’ of the battle. In his confusion, he no longer knew the course of action that he should take, and he turned to Krishna for guidance. Krishna talked to him, helping him to examine his own motives and desires, and showing him ways to rise above the limitations of his own personality to do what was best for himself and good for society. This dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, is the Bhagavad Gita.</p>

    <h4>Gita Ch 01 – Arjuna Vishada Yoga</h4>
    <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2768332.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>Arjuna the great warrior is overpowered by grief and delusion born out of a sense of attachment to his kith and kin. In his delusory state, he makes several fallacious arguments to support his decision not to fight. This sets the stage for the Lord’s teaching which comprises the rest of the Gita.Below are the main themes of Chapter 1:</p>

    <p>Arjuna acknowledges in the opening few verses that he is confused about his duty and surrenders to the Lord to instruct him about what is good for him. Thereafter, the Lord begins His teaching and by the end of the chapter, we get an exhaustive summary of the entire philosophical content of the Gita. Below are the main themes of Chapter 2:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 10:</strong>

<span><strong>
Verses 54 - 72:</strong>
Sthitaprajñatva-upāya and Sthitaprajña-lakṣaṇa - The Lord describes the characteristics of the one who is firmly established in the Self (Sthitaprajña) and highlights the Sadhanas or practices required to attain such a state, where one lives as a Jivan Mukta.
</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="maincontent">
    <h4>Gita Ch 03 – Karma Yoga - Path of Selfless Service</h4>
    <img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/osi/bg/28.jpg" style="height:400px;">

    <p>Having emphasized the importance of action in the previous chapter, here the Lord begins a gradual transition to the superiority of pursuing knowledge. Virtues of the man of knowledge are pointed out and a variety of worldy sadhanas are described as being rooted in action. But the Lord ends the chapter by exhorting Arjuna to action since right actions, as described in this chapter, are essential for readying the mind for knowledge.

    <img src="https://www.vastinfohub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gita-updesh-quotes-860x484.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>This chapter stands as a bridge between the action-oriented life extolled by the Lord in the previous two chapers and the life of contemplation that follows in the next. The emphasis here is on renunciation but the Lord makes it clear that this is a state of mind and explains the qualities of a true renunciate. Below are the main themes of Chapter 5:

</p>   <span><strong>Verses 1 - 6:</strong>
The two lifestyles sāṅkhya and yoga.</span>

<span><strong>Verses 7 - 12:</strong>

    <img src="https://www.bestinfohub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bhagavad-gita-quotes-300x210.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>This chapter provides practical methods of meditation for one who has purified the mind by diligently engaging in karma-yoga described in the previous chapters. For such a seeker, a life of contemplation is suggested along with an assurance that the path of meditation inevitably leads to the ultimate goal of Realization whether it be in the current life or a future one.

    <img src="https://motivationalwizard.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bhagavad-gita-quotes-960x960.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>The middle set of 6 chapters beginning with this one are an exposition of the Supreme Reality and how it seemingly manifests as the world we perceive. Here the Lord describes His so-called lower and higher natures and describes the different types of devotees. Those who are attracted to limited, worldly results which are part of His lower nature are granted those desires by His grace but the few who aspire to His higher nature can achieve oneness with Him. Below are the main themes of Chapter 7:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 3:</strong>

    <p>The previous chapter concluded by introducing certain technical terms and this one begins with an explanation of those. It then details various spiritual practices undertaken by those who desire to merge with the Supreme. This chapter also describes the two paths followed by the “jiva” after it leaves the body – one being the path of eventual return (to this world) and the other being the path of no return (krama-mukti).
Below are the main themes of Chapter 8:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 4:</strong>
Definition of the terms Brahman, adhyātma, karma, adhibūta, adhidaiva and adhiyajña.</span>

<span><strong>Verses 5 - 14:</strong>

<span><strong>
Verses 23 - 27:</strong>

    <img src="https://vedicfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bhagvad-gita-quotes-detechter.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>The previous chapter was a brief digression into techniques of saguna-upasana which is not the main theme of the Gita. Here the Lord continues the teaching as it was given in the 7th chapter and reiterates and expounds on those matters. He again points out that those who seek mere materialistic results can gain those by His grace but anyone who desires Him alone will merge with Him, regardless of their worldly conditionings based on gender, birth etc. Below are the main themes of Chapter 9::</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 3:</strong>
Introduction to the knowledge, its glory and necessary qualifica-tions</span>

    <h4>Gita Ch 10 – Vibhūti-Yoga - The Divine Glories</h4>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Y73cnXWS9P9ZNewbCVBqyQHaHa?w=1080&h=1080&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" style="height:400px;">
    <p>Arjuna acknowledges the Supreme nature of the Lord but asks how He can constantly be remembered even as one is perceiving this pluralistic world. In response, the Lord provides a long list of His glorious manifestations in the perceived universe. Lest anyone misunderstand that the Lord is limited to these forms, he concludes by saying that there is, in fact, no end to His glories. Below are the main themes of Chapter 10:</p>

<span><strong>Verses 1 - 3:</strong>
Introduction and the glory of this knowledge</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 4 - 7:</strong>
Lord’s glory in brief and the benefit of that knowledge</span>
<span><strong>

    <h4>Gita Ch 11 – Viśva-Rūpa-Darśana-Yoga - The Cosmic Form</h4>
    <img src="https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2023/Sep/krishna-janmashtami-quotes2_64f70d089fe3a.png" style="height:400px;">
    <p>In this chapter, Lord Krishna gifts Arjuna the divine vision which enables him to perceive the Lord in His Cosmic form – a form that even the Gods long to see but are unable to. The bulk of the chapter comprises of Arjuna describing the various sights he beholds within the Lord’s form. Whereas the previous chapter showcased the manifestations of the One Supreme Self in the many, this chapter completes the narrative by driving home the point that those many forms are, in fact, sustained in and part of that One Self, which alone is the reality. Below are the main themes of Chapter 11:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 4:</strong>
Arjuna desires to see the universal form

</span>

<span><strong>Verses 5 - 8:</strong>
Kṛṣṇa grants the divine eye.</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 9 - 14:</strong>
Sañjaya’s description of the universal form</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 15 - 22:</strong>
Arjuna’s description of the universal form(first phase expressing wonder)
</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 15 - 22</strong>
Arjuna’s description of the universal form(first phase expressing wonder)
<span><strong>
Verses 31 - 34:</strong>
Kṛṣṇa answers Arjuna’s question</span></p>
</div>

<div class="maincontent">
    <h4>Gita Ch 12:Bhakti-yoga - The Yoga of Devotion</h4>
    <img src="https://edumapsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-4.png" style="height:400px;">
    <p>The shortest chapter of the Gita but in some ways one of the most important ones because it clearly explains the meaning of a term that is often misunderstood – Bhakti. The Lord succinctly points out the attributes that denote a true Bhakta who is dear to Him, thereby providing us with a list of qualities we must strive to cultivate in ourselves. Below are the main themes of Chapter 12:

</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 2:</strong>
Verses 1 - 2
Arjuna’s question and Kṛṣṇa’s answer</span>

<span><strong>Verses 3 - 12:</strong>
The five stages of bhakti (prasādabuddhi, īśvarārpaṇabuddhi, iṣṭadevatā-upāsanā, virāḍ-upāsanā and akṣara-upāsanā jñā-nayoga)</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 13 - 19:</strong>
Traits of parābhakta (parābaktalakṣaṇa)</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 20:</strong>
Glory of the teaching
</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 35 - 47:</strong>
Arjuna’s delusion which stems from his ignorance about the true nature of oneself (moha)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="maincontent">
    <h4>Gita Ch 13 – Prakṛti-Puruṣa-Viveka-Yoga - The Yoga of Distinguishing Matter from Spirit</h4>
    <img src="https://img1.rapidleaks.com/2018/06/Bhagavad-Gita-LIfe-Lesson10.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>Whereas the first 6 chapters of the Gita were focused on the individual self (jiva) and the next 6 on the seemingly external Supreme Reality (Ishvara), the final 6 chapters beginning with this one show that they are actually one. The key to this oneness is the ability to disregard the transient and inert matter envelopments and understand the reality of the Self alone. To do that, one must know what constitutes matter and this chapter explains that using the concepts of “field” and “knower of the field”. Below are the main themes of Chapter 13:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1:</strong>
Introduction</span>

<span><strong>Verses 2 - 7:</strong>
Kṣetram and kṣetrajña</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 8 - 12:</strong>
Jñānam</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 13 - 19:</strong>
Jñeyam
</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 20 - 24:</strong>
Puruṣa and prakṛti</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 25 - 35:</strong>
Sādhanam and phalam</span></p>

<div class="maincontent">
    <h4>Gita Ch 14 – Guṇa-Traya-Vibhāga-Yoga - The Yoga of the Threefold Modalities</h4>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.X9v4HJNENDbpL64515oT-QHaEV?w=1024&h=600&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" style="height:400px;">
    <p>If the entire observed universe is nothing but the One Self expressing through the world of matter, how do we explain the endless variety of forms and experiences, each distinct from the other? This chapter answers that question by introducing the concept of the threefold “guna” which conditions all matter. Having explained how this works, the Lord points out  that our goal is to transcend beyond these gunas and recover our true, immortal nature. Below are the main themes of Chapter 14:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 4:</strong>
Introduction.</span>

<span><strong>Verses 5 - 18:</strong>
Analysis of guṇas</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 19 - 20:</strong>
Knowledge as the means to transcend the guṇas</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 21 - 27:</strong>
Guṇatīta-lakṣaṇam and sādhanam
</span>
</div>
<div class="maincontent">
    <h4>Gita Ch 15 – Puruṣottama-Yoga - The Yoga of the Ultimate Person</h4>
    <img src="https://www.vastinfohub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gita-sar-quotes.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>In this chapter, the Lord describes the nature of the Supreme Spirit in all its implications. This Spirit is effectively a secret for all of us since its comprehension seems beyond our grasp. Knowing the limitations of the mind, the Lord desribes the unknown in terms of the known and thus guides us towards that Unconditional Eternal Factor known as “Purushottama”. Below are the main themes of Chapter 15:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 3:</strong>
Description of saṃsāra</span>

<span><strong>Verses 3 - 6:</strong>
Means of liberation</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 7 - 11:</strong>
Brahman as jīva</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 12 - 15:</strong>
Brahman as jagat
</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 16 - 18:</strong>
Brahman as puruṣottama</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 19 - 20:</strong>
Glory of puruṣottama-jñānam</span></p>
</div>

    <h4>Gita Ch 16 – दैवासुरसम्पद्विभागयोग
Daivāsura-Sampad-Vibhāga-Yoga - The Yoga of Differentiating Godly and Ungodly Assets</h4>
<img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2768292.jpg" style="height:400px;">
    <p>What are the qualities one must cultivate in order to advance spiritually towards liberation and on the other hand, what are the qualities that will drag us down? Explaining those qualities, this chapter classifies beings into the divinely good (“deva”) and diabolically fallen (“asura”) and describes the behavior of the latter at length. This is so that we may introspect and understand where we stand and correct the course as necessary. Below are the main themes of Chapter 16:</p>
    <span><strong>Verses 1 - 3:</strong>
Verses 1 - 3
Daivī-sampat</span>

<span><strong>Verses 4 - 21:</strong>
Āsurī-sampat

Three types of food</span>
<span><strong>
Verses 22 - 24:</strong>
Three types of yajña

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c6/bb/6a/c6bb6a37ca685a90a3a5d908aebaeba6.jpg"style="height:400px;">
    <p>In this chapter, the Lord shows how the concept of “guna” that was detailed in the 14th chapter applies to faith, worship, food, sacrifices/rituals, austerities and charity. The Lord explains that these common activities can each be categorized as sattvic, rajasic or tamasic depending on the manner in which they are conducted. Our goal is to engage in only the sattvic varieties since that alone is conducive to spiritual development. Below are the main themes of Chapter 17:</p>
